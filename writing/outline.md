The Prevention of Child Maltreatment in The Bronx

1.	How do we prevent child maltreatment? 
a.	When does child development begin and what are the most critical years?
i.	Bowlby says it begin in infancy, if not shortly after birth
ii.	We need to get to children as fast as possible
iii.	Staying with the biological parents is ideal but not always possible
b.	What methods of prevention already exist?
c.	Introducing the group attachment based intervention study
2.	The Group Intervention
a.	What is the breakdown
i.	Explaining the intervention study, how it works, community components
b.	What is the history of the group
3.	Adverse Childhood Experiences
a.	Defining ACEs, how they work, how can they be flatlined
4.	Where is the Study Being Implemented
a.	Einstein Hospital
b.	Lead Researchers
5.	What are the goals for growth
6.	What does that data being collected look like?
a.	Is there a change occurring in parents and children who undergo this therapy?
b.	What does the data look like…
7.	Secure Attachment of the Mother
a.	Defining “success” in the eyes of this research and what more secure attachment between mother/child looks like
8.	Methods of Sharing Qualitative Data
a.	Using Bronx footage to broaden the study and teach the methods
b.	Showing examples of development within a specific child or case
9.	Visualizing what happens to children who suffer more than 3 ACEs
a.	Dots representing each life of a child who is born into an abusive environment and how long they may be able to survive it
b.	Roe vs. Wade situation where children who were meant to be aborted end up as criminals anyways 
i.	No solution for protecting these children from their environments, foster care is often even worse, how can we give them securely attached relationships that they may be able to bounce back from.
10.	Concluding thoughts on this “starfish story” approach (‘I can help THIS one child’)
a.	Despite not being able to remedy every issue of child maltreatment, studies like this intervention are making leaps to FLATLINE stats and prevent as many future cases of abusive for each individual

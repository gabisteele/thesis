The Prevention of Child Maltreatment in The Bronx

1.	Introduction – Introducing GABI & goals for the visualization of its data
a.	Bowlby’s theory of Attachment
b.	The origins and relevance the Group Attachment Based Intervention
c.	3 tiers of stakeholders 
d.	Goals of the project and humanistic methods of execution

2.	Goals of the Group Attachment Based Intervention – Flat lining ACEs – Child Maltreatment History
a.	Tackling child maltreatment is hard, what are the realistic goals GABI is attempting to achieve? How?
b.	They can’t solve or erase past trauma but they can help flat line it and limit reoccurrences as well as assist adults in becoming more “resolved” about past suffering and trauma. 

3.	Why should we be visualizing this information? (macro – 3 tiers of stakeholders)
a.	Lack of design involved in the documentation and sharing of psychological studies at data, despite need and interest – experts and researcher stakeholders
b.	Hugely important study tackling a serious global issue that directly effects our communities and society – parents and children stakeholders
c.	Making this data accessible opens up unique and highly scalable opportunities to greater social working community and beyond that can adopt methods and studies more easily if made visually and readily available – social worker stakeholders

4.	What benefits will this project attempt to offer the GABI project specifically? (micro – what each visualization will do for the stakeholders)
a.	Researchers and social workers are currently struggling a lot with the ‘Udemy’ online learning platform that is being used to teach the study to new trainees – current platform is NOT human centered (intermediate level)
b.	Could potentially discover regressions/correlations/patterns in the data by visualizing it, that had not yet been entirely considered or explored by the researchers themselves (expert level)
c.	Would be extremely helpful to have a tangible visualization that portrayed the entire scope of the project to potential investors/grant purposes etc

5.	Significance of human centered design when working with human subject data
a.	When portraying data directly representing human subjects, there is a more imminent need for a humanistic approach to be considered in addition to rendering a human centered design that makes the information especially accessible to those studying it
b.	Meaning, it is important to portray the qualitative and human aspects of the work in a way that other humans can engage with it on a relatable level not only basic and comprehensible level (as the human centered design approach focuses on)
c.	Basically identifying the significance of humanistic approach and difference between that and creating a human centered design…

6.	Effectiveness of online learning platforms…
a.	Online learning platforms are notoriously inexpensive and notoriously ineffective
b.	Examining research of online learning platforms and their failures/successes
c.	What makes for an effective online learning platform? → human centered design? 

7.	Ground Level Visualization related to the families themselves
a.	The project hopes not to tokenize these individuals and therefore plans to create a platform that they can also engage with
b.	Would be ideal if this component addressed drop rates and why so many families leave the study/how best to make them stay

8.	The benefits of all 3 visualizations 
a.	primary component is a holistic representation of all the data (expert level), 
b.	secondary representation yet likely most important is restructuring/redesigning training website using video content in a human centered design (intermediate level) 
c.	third artistic and abstract platform that relates to families is a unique method of using data and visuals to create some kind of simple treatment level for the families, something they could personally engage with that proved their progress, improvements and accomplishments without belittlement or a condescending tone

9.	Conclusion

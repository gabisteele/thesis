###Data Visualization of Child Maltreatment and Group Attachment Based Intervention Study 

The effects of visualizing both individual components and the holistic effects of trauma centered data and research being collected can be exponentially beneficial for both internal and external stakeholders. This project attempts to address three tiers of stakeholders through the production of visualizations and web based platforms to improve the experience of all audiences interacting with the Group Attachment Based Intervention Study and the data surrounding it. These tiers can be divided into: the expert level, regarding researchers conducting the study and examining data to prove correlations, regressions and the impact of the work; the intermediate level, social workers and communities of potential trainees looking to adopt the study and learn how to successfully deliver it; and the ground level, families themselves who have engaged with and merited from the treatment. Using JavaScript libraries such as node.js and d3.js, this data visualization project works to address each of these audiences through redesigning their methods of engaging with the data and portraying it to a greater public audience. The primary visualization works to depict the impact this study has had on low-income families in the Bronx and identify factors that prove this work is superior to current treatment methods being delivered to families in that region and beyond.

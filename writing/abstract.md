###Visualizing the Group Attachment Based Intervention Study: Working to Reduce Child Maltreatment in Vulnerable Families


This project was fueled by the notion that the majority of data shared amongst the Social Science community -- specifically the field of Child Attachment -- is done so using static forms of communication. Scholarly articles, grants, and research papers serve as the dominant method of distributing work. This visualization sought to challenge that status quo by creating a digital resource that shared data collected by The Group Attachment Based Intervention (GABI), study. The intervention is a pragmatic clinical trial focused on reducing child maltreatment in vulnerable families. It was developed jointly by The New School for Social Research Center for Attachment and Einstein Albert Einstein College of Medicineâ€™s Center for Babies, Toddlers and Families, in the South Bronx, the poorest congressional district in the United States. 

The intervention targets marginalized families at high risk of maltreatment and abuse, specifically working with children ages 0-3. One in four children in the United States experience child maltreatment at some point in their lives and one fourth of those cases occur to babies under the age of 3. The innovation behind this clinical trial surrounds including babies in the intervention rather than solely hosting parenting groups without offering any therapy or supervised play to their children. The control group in the data set, known as STEP, is the most popular parenting treatment option available in New York State.
